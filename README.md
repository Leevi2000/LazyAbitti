# LazyAbitti
a tool that is supposed to search if there's new ABITTI version available, and then download (the file) automatically

This works only on windows computers 

You can make this boot automatically on pc startup
> Make a shortcut of the exe file (the exe can be downloaded here if you don't want to do it yourself: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OrQ_K3Exzye10rwIW_0DOfA1ai237z6h/view?usp=sharing)
> Press win+r and type shell:startup
> Move shortcut to the folder that just opened

-This is just my small project, and doesn't have anything to do with abitti developers
I might add more features later
